A random event, such as a coin flip, will have an equal chance of being heads or tails. But after you get 5 heads in a row, you may start to believe that a tails result is "due" to happen (cold), or a heads result is "hot" (going to happen again). Now apply this thinking to a roulette wheel, with its individual numbers, and its red or black squares. After 5 black results, would it be unreasonable to think that red is "due"? In a pick 2 or 3 or 4 lottery, if a certain sequence of numbers hits more often than expected, is it "hot"? Powerball has 69 balls in play at every draw. Are certain numbers "hot" or "cold" at the moment?
